spreadsheet.py combines python-excel (xlrd, xlwt) and openpyxl to allow a single set of commands for editing .xls and .xlsx files in Python.

The commands for using this library can be found at the openpyxl site (http://pythonhosted.org/openpyxl/) with the only change being that openpyxl will be replaced with spreadsheet.

e.g. openpyxl.load_workbook('test.xlsx')

will be:
spreadsheet.load_workbook('test.xlsx')

and this will also work now:
spreadsheet.load_workbook('test.xls')
